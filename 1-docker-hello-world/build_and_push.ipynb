    "### Introduction to Docker and Containerization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a platform that simplifies building, packaging, and running applications in isolated environments called **containers**. \n",
    "Containers are lightweight and portable because they bundle only the necessary libraries and dependencies, making applications run consistently across different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image:** A Docker image is a read-only template that contains the application code, libraries, and dependencies required to run an application.\n",
    "* **Container:** A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It's a lightweight and isolated environment that has its own filesystem, networking, and processes.\n",
    "* **Dockerfile:** A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Containerization\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Consistency:** Docker ensures applications run the same way, regardless of the host operating system or infrastructure.\n",
    "*   **Isolation:** Applications and their dependencies are isolated within containers, preventing conflicts and improving security.\n",
    "*   **Portability:** Docker containers can be easily moved and run on different machines, such as laptops, servers, and cloud providers, that have Docker installed.\n"
