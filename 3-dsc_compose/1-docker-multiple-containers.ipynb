    "### Understanding Docker Isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker containers, by default, run in isolated environments, meaning they cannot communicate with each other unless explicitly configured to do so. In this setup, the frontend and backend containers are isolated. So, if you try to access the backend from the frontend, it won’t work by default, because Docker treats them as separate entities.\n",

    "### Task: Connecting Multiple Containers Using Docker CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect the frontend and backend containers, you'll need to set up a Docker network that allows the containers to communicate. Here's how to do that step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Stop and Remove Any Running Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, **stop** and **remove** any containers you’ve already started for the frontend and backend, as running duplicate containers can cause conflicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker stop frontend-container backend-container\n",
    "docker rm frontend-container backend-container\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Create a Docker Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new network that both the frontend and backend containers can use to communicate with each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker network create app-network\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Run the Backend Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the backend container (`fhtw-ai-backend`) and attach it to the newly created network:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -d --name backend-container --network app-network -p 8080:80 fhtw-ai-backend\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`--network app-network`**: Connects the container to the `app-network`.\n",
    "- The backend is now part of this network, but it’s still isolated from the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Run the Frontend Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the frontend container (`fhtw-ai-frontend`) and connect it to the same network:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -d --name frontend-container --network app-network -p 80:80 fhtw-ai-frontend\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now both the frontend and backend containers are on the same network, enabling them to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Test the Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, try accessing the frontend app at `http://localhost:80`.\n",
    "- The frontend should communicate with the backend using the **backend container name**, e.g., `http://backend-container:8080`.\n",
    "- If the communication fails, think about why this might be happening. Do both containers have access to each other?\n",

    "### Recap of Docker CLI Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stop and remove running containers**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker stop frontend-container backend-container\n",
    "  docker rm frontend-container backend-container\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a network**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker network create app-network\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run the backend container**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker run -d --name backend-container --network app-network -p 8080:80 fhtw-ai-backend\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run the frontend container**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker run -d --name frontend-container --network app-network -p 80:80 fhtw-ai-frontend\n",

    "### Next Step: Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing networks manually works for small projects, but Docker Compose makes it easier to manage multi-container applications with shared networks. Now that you’ve seen how to connect containers using Docker CLI, we will move on to using **Docker Compose**, which simplifies this process significantly for larger setups."
