    "### Docker Compose: Simplifying Multi-Container Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you’ve experienced connecting containers using the Docker CLI, let's move on to **Docker Compose**, which is a more efficient and scalable way to manage multi-container applications. With Compose, you can define multiple services (containers) in a single `docker-compose.yml` file, and Docker Compose will automatically handle networking, image building, and container startup order for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Compose File Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the Docker Compose file you’ll be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "version: '3.3'\n",
    "\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  frontend:\n",
    "    build: frontend\n",
    "    image: fhtw-ai-frontend\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - 80:${STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT:-8501}\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      - APP_BACKEND_URL=http://backend\n",
    "      - STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=${STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT:-8501}\n",
    "    depends_on:\n",
    "      - backend\n",
    "\n",
    "  backend:\n",
    "    build: backend\n",
    "    image: fhtw-ai-backend\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - 8080:80\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **version**: Specifies the version of Docker Compose. Version 3.3 is used to ensure compatibility with modern features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **services**: \n",
    "   - Defines the two services, `frontend` and `backend`, that represent the Streamlit frontend and FastAPI backend.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **frontend**:\n",
    "   - **build**: Specifies the directory containing the Dockerfile for the frontend (`./frontend`).\n",
    "   - **image**: The name of the Docker image to create (`fhtw-ai-frontend`).\n",
    "   - **ports**: Maps port 80 on the host to port `8501` (or the value of `STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT` if defined).\n",
    "   - **environment**: Defines environment variables. `APP_BACKEND_URL` tells the frontend where to find the backend, and `STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT` defines the port for the frontend.\n",
    "   - **depends_on**: Ensures that the `backend` service starts before the `frontend` service. This guarantees that the backend is running when the frontend tries to connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **backend**:\n",
    "   - **build**: Specifies the directory containing the Dockerfile for the backend (`./backend`).\n",
    "   - **image**: The name of the Docker image to create (`fhtw-ai-backend`).\n",
    "   - **ports**: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container, exposing the backend API.\n",

    "### Running the Application with Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker Compose simplifies running multiple containers with a single command:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start the Application**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   To build and run both the frontend and backend containers with Docker Compose, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker-compose up\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This command will:\n",
    "     - Build the Docker images (`fhtw-ai-frontend` and `fhtw-ai-backend`) if they aren’t already built.\n",
    "     - Start both containers in the correct order.\n",
    "     - Automatically connect them through a shared network (you don’t need to create the network manually).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stop the Application**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   To stop the running containers, simply use:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker-compose down\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This will stop and remove the containers and any associated networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Networking**: Docker Compose automatically creates a network and assigns each container a name. In your case, the `frontend` container can refer to the `backend` container using its service name (`backend`) without needing to configure networks manually.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Simplified Management**: You can start, stop, and manage multiple services with just one command, making it far more convenient than running separate `docker run` commands for each service.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build and Run Together**: Compose handles both the image building and running steps together, which ensures that any code changes in your application are reflected when you rebuild your containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap of Docker Compose Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start the services**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker-compose up\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stop the services**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker-compose down\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Docker Compose, you are streamlining the process of building, running, and connecting multi-container applications. In complex systems where multiple services need to communicate, Compose ensures that everything is coordinated correctly, from networking to container startup order."
