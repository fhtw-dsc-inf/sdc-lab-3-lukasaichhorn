    "### Wrapping Docker Commands with Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you’ve worked with individual Docker commands to build and run containers, we’ll simplify the process using **Docker Compose**. Docker Compose allows you to define how containers should be built, connected, and run using a single \"blueprint\" (the `docker-compose.yml` file). This makes managing complex applications easier, especially when dealing with multiple containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start with Docker Compose, ensure that any currently running containers are **stopped** and **removed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker stop fhtw-streamlit-container\n",
    "docker rm fhtw-streamlit-container\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Compose File Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the Compose file that wraps the necessary commands for running your **Streamlit application**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "version: '3.3'\n",
    "\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  fhtw-streamlit-container:\n",
    "    build: streamlit\n",
    "    image: streamlit_app\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - 80:${STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT:-8501}\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      - STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=${STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT:-8501}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **version: '3.3'**:\n",
    "   - Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format to use. Version `3.3` ensures compatibility with modern features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **services**:\n",
    "   - Defines the containers that Docker Compose will manage. In this case, we have a single service (`fhtw-streamlit-container`), which represents your Streamlit application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **fhtw-streamlit-container**:\n",
    "   - **build: streamlit**: This tells Docker Compose to build the image from the `streamlit/` directory, where the Dockerfile for the Streamlit application is located.\n",
    "   - **image: streamlit_app**: Specifies the name of the image to create (`streamlit_app`). This image is built from the instructions in the Dockerfile located in the `streamlit` directory.\n",
    "   - **ports**: Maps port `80` on the host machine to the port inside the container where the Streamlit app is running (default is `8501`). The `STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT` environment variable allows for flexibility; if it's set, it will be used as the container’s internal port.\n",
    "   - **environment**: Defines environment variables for the container. Here, it’s setting the port the Streamlit app will run on inside the container using `STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running with Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build the Services**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   To build the Docker images specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker-compose build\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This will build the `streamlit_app` image based on the `streamlit/` directory and its Dockerfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build and Run the Service**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   After building the image, you can start the container by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker-compose up\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This will build the image (if not already built) and start the container as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.\n",
    "   - The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:80`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stop the Service**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   To stop the container and clean up, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker-compose down\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This stops and removes the running container.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified Workflow**: Instead of running multiple commands (`docker build`, `docker run`, etc.), Docker Compose combines everything into a single file and a single command.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Automatic Networking**: Compose automatically creates a network for your services. Containers can communicate with each other using their service names (e.g., `fhtw-streamlit-container`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portability**: The `docker-compose.yml` file acts as a blueprint that can easily be shared and run in different environments, ensuring consistency in how the application is built and run.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Docker Compose, you streamline your workflow and simplify the process of managing multi-container applications."
